Currently under development / to be updated ; Open source GNU distribution for open source development on multiple platforms including; PS4, RaspbPI and such like! Linux based! There will be more information as this project progresses!







Old branches; https://drive.google.com/open?id=170oCANeUeznL8y-EWzQeNNmv3OkXjMhz - These where previously unreleased and unfinished builds of this distro! Sources where lost due to website maintenance!
These original builds consist of; 0.0.1 and 0.1.1 Run level 1 / GUI gnome - The 0.1.1 GUI version, encountered errors when booting the image, It would stick after initiating the GUI and or bootloader. Previous investigation showed up nothing, Any help or information would be very appreciated!
